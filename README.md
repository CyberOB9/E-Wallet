E-Wallet Application
The purpose of this project is to create or develop an app (e-wallet) that is a way to carry cash in the digital format that has replaced cash and cards in the last few years. It is a more convenient, secure, and fastest way to perform transactions, pay bills, and view transaction details using smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. 

This app will alleviate the stress of going to ATMs and standing in bank queues to withdraw money and pay utility bills etc. Being aware of this problem helps to find effective and secure ways to solve it. It has become a comprehensive solution for all payment needs. With such technical advancements, customers do not need to take the risk of carrying physical cash or cards while making a payment.
